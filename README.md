# UFOs

## Overview:
Developed an interactive dashboard accessible on a webpage, allowing users to organize and filter reported UFO sightings.
The filtering functionality of the dashboard allows users to refine the table data based on various criteria, including date, city, state, country, and description. 
This capability enables users to narrow down their search and extract specific UFO sighting records they are interested in.  Users are able to pursue diverse objectives, such as conducting thorough research, obtaining valuable insights, and identifying potential trends. 

#### Results

To apply filters to the data, the user inputs their desired search criteria into the corresponding fields (date, city, state, country, shape) and presses the enter key or tabs to the next field. Based on the available data, the user can further refine their search by adding additional criteria in another search field, effectively narrowing down the resulting data output.

Image 1: The initial filter was applied to the State field by using "ca" as the search criteria, representing California.

## Summary:

Although the dashboard is excellent, it would have been beneficial to have a graphical visualization accompanying the data table output. Additionally, there are numerous opportunities to enhance this dashboard and provide an improved user experience. For instance, including concise instructions on how to filter the data, implementing a Search button and dropdown menus for the fields, and incorporating an option to select a date range instead of a specific date. These enhancements would contribute to a more user-friendly and comprehensive dashboard.
